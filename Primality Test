==========================[Primality Test]============================
A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.
Given number N check if it is prime or not.

Example 1:
Input: N = 5
Output: Yes
Explanation: 5 is only divisible by 1 and itself. So, 5 is a prime number.

Example 2:
Input: N = 4
Output: No
Explanation: 4 is divisible by 2. So, 4 is not a prime number.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function isPrime() that takes N as input parameter and returns True if N is prime else returns False. 

Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2)
Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 109

Solution:
class Solution{
    public:
        bool isPrime(int N)
    {
        //Your code here
        for(int i=2;i*i<=N; i++){
            if(N%i==0)
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

};
