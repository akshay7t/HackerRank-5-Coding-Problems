Given a positive integer value N. The task is to find how many numbers less than or equal to N have numbers of divisors exactly equal to 3.

Example 1:
Input: N = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The only number less than 6 with 
3 divisors is 4.

Example 2:
Input: N = 10
Output: 2
Explanation: 4 and 9 have 3 divisors.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function exactly3Divisors() that takes N as input parameter and returns count of numbers less than or equal to N with exactly 3 divisors.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N1/2 * N1/4)
Expected Auxilliary Space :  O(1)

Constraints: 1 <= N <= 109

Solution:
class Solution
{
    
    public int exactly3Divisors(int N)
    {
        //Your code here
        int d=0;
        if(N<4)
        return 0;
        for(int i=4; i<=N;i++){
            int c=0;
            for(int j=1; j<=i*i; j++){
                if(i%j==0)
                c++;
            }
           if(c==3)
           d++;
        }
        return d;
    }
}
